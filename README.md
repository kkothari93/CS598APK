## Spectrally accurate hybrid direct solver for frequency domain scattering

The repo implements some work by Gillman, Barnett and Martinsson on solving variable media Helmholtz scattering

I have been trying to implement this without much success. I will keep working on it. I will post results as I have them. To show that the merge process creates a resonable unitary operator, $R_0$, I post the eighenvalues of the same.

Eigenvalues of the ItI map of the root node:
